  - title: "Building DevOps tools for game studios"
    speakers:
      - name: "Alexandros Emexezidis"
        url: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/emexezidis/"
    description: "Game developers need different tooling than typical DevOps teams. They think in game systems, not infrastructure primitives, and need quick answers to questions like: What build is deployed where? Which commits finished building? How are our servers performing right now? Alex will demo Deployment Overview, an internal Blazor platform built to give game developers self-service visibility into deployments, build pipelines, test results, and server performance."

  - title: "From Blindness to Supervision: The Journey to Observability"
    speakers:
      - name: "Pavlos Karakalidis"
        url: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlos-karakalidis/"
    description: "Ever shipped a distributed system only to realize you're flying blind in production? This talk challenges the notion that observability is just another tool you add at the end—it's a mindset that must be designed in from the start. Pavlos will cut through the fragmented landscape of proprietary APM agents and incompatible telemetry formats to show why OpenTelemetry has become the one instrumentation layer to rule them all. Through a (not so live) demo spanning EKS and Lambda, you'll see unified tracing, metrics, and logs across your entire stack."
